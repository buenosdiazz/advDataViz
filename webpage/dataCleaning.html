        It is not ideal to exclude a menu from inner pages, but the
        focus is on data visualization, not site design. This
        'breadcrumb' approach will keep things simple while the
        site added to week-to-week, but considers the necessity to
        to swap out the nav on each page (for the completed one on
        'index.html') and make minor modifications to 'style.css' to
        create a more robust site nav once all examples are complete.

        <p>In this week’s class, we discussed data cleaning and different ways in which we can work with raw data. <Br><Br>

Some of the main takeaways were:
    <ul>
<li>Begin with data in plain text formal (if possible)</li>
<li>Do not perform calculations in raw data file</li>
<li>Avoid spaces (use dashes and underscores instead)</li>
<li>Use lowercase</li>
<li>Fill in all cells </li>
</ul>

During class, we also took a look at the Titanic data set and examined how we could improve it with data cleaning. This data set provided information about various characteristics about passengers on the Titanic, such as passenger gender, class, age, and whether or not the person survived. <Br><Br>

After reviewing the data, we noted that there were several improvements that could be made.
    <ul>
<li> Separate the name variable into last name, first name, and title variables</li>
<li> Use “1,2,3” instead of “1st, 2nd, 3rd” for the pclass variable </li>
<li> Separate home.dest variable into two variables “city” and “state”</li>
<li>Fill empty cells with “null”</li>
</ul>
Using excel we also discovered some interesting information by filtering with variables and using the COUNTIF function. For example, we learned that more women survived than men and first class had the highest survival rate. <Br><br>

We also discussed the extra considerations that are needed when using data in code. Some JavaScript friendly variable types are:<ul>
<li>String</li>
<li>Number</li>
<li>Boolean (true/false)</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Objects</li>
</ul>
Whenever we are using data with code it is important to conform to the programming language’s syntax. <br><Br>

Coincidentally, the first time I heard about data cleaning was last week at my job at the Toppel Career Center. My supervisor, the Associate Director of Assessment & Communication, is in charge of collecting the data from the graduating student survey that provides a snapshot of students’ post-graduation plans. She held a “data-cleaning” party in which everyone in the office got together to review and revise the survey data. <br><Br>

Practicing data cleaning in my job/ seeing its real-world application helped me understand how much work it is (it takes a village)! Even though it seems tedious, it is necessary to make sure that the results produced from the data are consistent and accurate.
