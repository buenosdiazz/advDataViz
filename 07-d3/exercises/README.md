# 07 d3

This week we're working with [d3](https://d3js.org/), a library which binds data to HTML and SVG elements.


## d3

Team up with another student in class and agree upon a type of chart you would like to learn about. (No bar charts.) Each student should build the chart with data related to their respective subject for inclusion in the exercise portfolio.

Your chart(s) should include at least one interactive element. You and your parter may choose to implement different interactive features.

During the next class session you will:

- Showcase the two charts built.
- Lead the class in a walkthrough on how to build the chart(s) you learned about. It is advisable to prepare files in advance for other students to follow along with the walkthrough. Please make these accessible via GitHub for easy download.
